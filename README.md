# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Twitter
## Introduction:
Sentiment analysis (sometimes known as opinion mining or emotion AI) refers to the use of [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), [text analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining), [computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics), and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.

Generally speaking, sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation (see appraisal theory), affective state (that is to say, the emotional state of the author or speaker), or the intended emotional communication (that is to say, the emotional effect intended by the author or interlocutor).
